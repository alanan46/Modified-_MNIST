# Comp-551-Project-3
Repo to host code for Project 3 of COMP-551 Applied Machine Learning.

The main module for the artifical neural network implemented is called aNN.py

The main module for the convolutional neural network implemented is kcNN/trainer/kerascNN.py

The script that generates prediction result is predict/prediction.py Note that the actual model we trained is not uploaded
