Repo to host code for Project 3 of COMP-551 Applied Machine Learning.

The main module for the artifical neural network implemented is called aNN.py

It is run by the driver named _____

The main module for the convolutional neural network implemented is kcNN/trainer/kerascNN_final.py

The script that generates prediction for cNN result is predict/prediction.py Note that the actual model we trained is not 

uploaded 

The toyaNN.py and toyaNN_driver.py are testing modules. We tried a vector memorization problem with it to see

whether the aNN implemented works or not.
